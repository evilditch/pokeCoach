The base for life improvement is creation of a daily schedule depending on users needs. For example If major executive function issues then a very spesific daily schedule is available, if mood is the only major issue, then matters concerning mood improvement are scheduled. The application will be very flexible when faced with changing needs or need for stronger behavioral support.
